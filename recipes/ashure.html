				<h2>Description about Ashure</h2>
				<p>
					Ashure is a traditional sweet and salty mixture specific to Turkish
					cuisine. Usually prepared during the month of Muharram, ashure is
					cooked to commemorate the events that occurred at Kerbala, where the
					grandson of Prophet Muhammad, Hz. Hüseyin, was martyred. Therefore,
					ashure also represents feelings of solidarity, unity, and
					togetherness. Ashure, which contains various ingredients such as
					wheat, chickpeas, hazelnuts, dried grapes, apricots, and pomegranates,
					is prepared with different variations in different regions. Ashure is
					usually shared and eaten among families and can also be distributed
					among neighbors.
