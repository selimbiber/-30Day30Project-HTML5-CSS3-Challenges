        <h2>Description about Ashure</h2>
        <p>Ashure is a traditional sweet and salty mixture specific to Turkish cuisine. Usually prepared during the month of Muharram, ashure is cooked to commemorate the events that occurred at Kerbala, where the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, Hz. Hüseyin, was martyred. Therefore, ashure also represents feelings of solidarity, unity, and togetherness. Ashure, which contains various ingredients such as wheat, chickpeas, hazelnuts, dried grapes, apricots, and pomegranates, is prepared with different variations in different regions. Ashure is usually shared and eaten among families and can also be distributed among neighbors.</p>
