                <h2>Description about Turkish Doner Kebab</h2>
                <p>Turkish Doner Kebab is a delicious Middle Eastern dish that has become a popular fast food item in many countries around the world. It consists of a flavorful mix of meat, vegetables, and sauce, all wrapped in a warm pita or flatbread. The dish is made by layering slices of meat, traditionally lamb or chicken, on a vertical spit and cooking it slowly. The meat is then shaved off in thin slices and served with fresh vegetables, such as lettuce, tomato, and onion. The dish is topped off with a tangy yogurt or tomato-based sauce. Turkish Doner Kebab is a popular street food in Turkey, but it has become a global phenomenon, with variations of the dish popping up in almost every country.</h2>
