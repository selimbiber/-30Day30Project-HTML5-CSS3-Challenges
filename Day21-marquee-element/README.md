# Instructions for Marquee Element

## In this lab you have to create a marquee element using CSS, which would make the text scroll from right to left.

## The default Marquee Tag in HTML has been deprecated. Even though the marquee tag is no longer recommended to use according the web standards, for backwards compatability, it is still supported in most web browsers.

## However, for this lab, you would be using CSS to recreate the marquee animation.
